            <p>Hello, I am Meetali Kapse. I am a <strong>Third Year Information Technology Student </strong>at <i>Thadomal Shahani Engineering College</i> .<br><br>
                I am currently learning Front-End Development and UI/UX designing.
                I am very passionate about designing for inclusion and bridging the gap between technology and human experiences. 
                Currently serving the position of <strong>Design Head</strong> at <i>IETE-TSEC</i>, former to that 
                I was a design executive for last academic year where I collaborated with various other teams in my committee to
                create posts for the Instagram page, website for our committee and banners for the flagship events.
                I am also very passionate about expanding opportunities for underrepresented communities in computer science and creating solutions for real-world problems. 
                <br><br>
                I won the <b>ERR_404 5.0 Hackathon</b> with an all girls team, where I contributed it the designing and front-end of the project. I was awarded an scholarship from <i>Kode With Klossy</i> where I learned Web Development in a two-week coding intensive camp.
                I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow as a designer and developer. If you share my passion for designing with purpose and making a difference through technology, I would love to connect and explore ways to collaborate.</p>
